# kaiseki — APK Analysis Workbench

> **★★★ CSE / Knowable Construction.** This repo operates under **Constructive Substrate Engineering** — canonical specification at [`pleme-io/theory/CONSTRUCTIVE-SUBSTRATE-ENGINEERING.md`](https://github.com/pleme-io/theory/blob/main/CONSTRUCTIVE-SUBSTRATE-ENGINEERING.md). The Compounding Directive (operational rules: solve once, load-bearing fixes only, idiom-first, models stay current, direction beats velocity) is in the org-level pleme-io/CLAUDE.md ★★★ section. Read both before non-trivial changes.


Complete APK teardown. Consumes all format parser traits from andro-core.
